	This very brief history of the Meanderthals will hopefully be expanded in the future!</p>

	The Meanderthals started in the 1990's as a hiking group called the Easy Striders
	through the Unitarian Universalist Church in Hendersonville, N.C.
	The group met every Monday at 9:30 a.m. The Easy Striders then broke off into 
	an independent hiking group. The first hiking leader was Dean Crawford.
	After Dean was unable to lead the hikes, Keith Howell took over as leader
	for many years. Following Keith Howell the group was informally led by
	"Ping" Crawford and/or "Chuck" Stevens. When those folks and other "old timers"
	become unable to lead hikes, Wayne B'Rells "inherited" the organizer position.
	(Prior to that time Wayne had been maintaining a website with data on many of
	the Meanderthal hikes and was therefore quite familiar with the local trails.)
	Since Wayne started organizing trips most hikers are now residents of The Oaks
	condominium development, although "outsiders" are encouraged to join the group!
	<br><br>
	The Meanderthals meet every Monday and Thursday, weather permitting. For many years
	the group left at 9:30 a.m. from the Ingles parking lot in Laurel Park. Now, since most
	hikers are residents of The Oaks, the meeting location has been changed to the
	Clubhouse Parking area at The Oaks. Hikes are generally 4 to 6 miles over varied
	terrain in either DuPont State Forest or Pisgah National Forest. The group usually
	gets back by 3:00 p.m. Hikes are quite slow-paced to allow time to stop and
	"smell the flowers" along the way. On the way back the group frequently stops for ice cream! 
	<br><br>
	Before each hike Wayne sends out emails with brief descriptions of the trail and
	comments about any special conditions that may be encountered. Please contact Wayne at
