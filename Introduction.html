	The trips recorded on this site were logged by Wayne B'Rells for the benefit of the
	Meanderthal hiking group. GPS data is gathered in KMZ format using Google's
	"My Tracks" app running on a variety of smartphones.(The original
	"My Tracks" app is no longer available for download, but fortunately I've been
	able to "migrate" that app to each new phone.)
	<br><br>
	This GPS data is then downloaded to my home computer and integrated into
	<span class="regular-bold-text">Google My Maps</span> which provides the
	 actual mapping data. 
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, elevations recorded by most GPS units are quite inaccurate.
	Therefore, I have used the <span class="bold-underlined-text">gpsvisualizer.com</span> website
	to correct the elevation data logged by the GPS device. This web site uses
	information derived from NASA's SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation
	data set and/or the USGS's NED (National Elevation Dataset). This updated
	elevation data is then used to generate a (Profile) page for each hike.
	<br><br>
	Elevation data is generally shown on a graph with 100 foot vertical
	increments. (A uniform vertical scale allows the true difficulty of each hike 
	to be better appreciated!) In a few cases -- where we have undertaken more ambitious
	hikes -- a 200 foot vertical increment was required. These cases, however, should
	be very obvious.
	<br><br>
	In most cases, the starting and ending elevations will be approximately
	the same. There are some exceptions, however:
	</p>
	<ol class="regular-text">
	<li>If a car swap is involved.</li>
	<li>If the GPS recording does not start immediately.</li>
	<li>If the GPS recording is unexpectedly stopped before the end of the hike. </li>
	<li>If the GPS unit was unable to track certain sections of the hike.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="regular-text">
	A quick glance at the map itself should show if conditions 1-3 are involved.
	In case 4, there  will unusually be a "break" in the line showing the profile.
	<br><br>
	Since this corrected elevation data is much more accurate than that recorded
	by the GPS device, I will not be including any elevation data on the (Statistics)
	page for each hike.
	<br><br>
	Please be aware that GPS data logged by my phone (or any other GPS receiver)
	is only accurate to about 10 meters (30 feet) under the best of circumstances.
	Unfortunately(?) many of these hikes took place under heavy tree cover
	and/or in mountain valleys where GPS signals are often weak and/or entirely
	missing. AS A RESULT, some of the tracks recorded on these maps MAY be quite
	inaccurate or missing in places. (For example, the Big Glassy hike of 4/6/2014
	shows a wild deviation about halfway up the the trail.) 
	<br><br>
	Please let me know if you have any questions / suggestions concerning these maps!
